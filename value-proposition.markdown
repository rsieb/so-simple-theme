# The pain tech founders face


Venture-backed boards oust 60% of founder-CEOs within four years after founding their company. Usually the excuse is that they “didn’t scale”.

After raising series B especially, the team's zeal seems to diminish. Things start slowing down and results start to disappoint. The rockstar CEO loses their shine and is soon asked to leave. It is a personal drama for the founder to "give up their baby".

Especially if the drama at the venture continues. The new CEO is more likely to oversee further disappointments than engineer a turnaround. And then what can the Board do?


# A comprehensive scaling playbook for founder-CEOs


What if the founder-CEO could count on a trusted ally to help them scale? What if founder-CEOs...




  * Could add to their unique vision and inspiration the best skills in scaling a tech company?


  * Could see their teams learn to deliver more reliable results than any hired CEO could?


  * Could "scale" growth, employee engagement, results and profitability all at the same time?


I serve as a trusted scale-up ally to Silicon Valley founder-CEOs. I help founder-CEOs and their teams:


  1. understand the differences between startup and scale-up


  2. see the changes they can make to get better results


  3. and avoid the pitfalls of “turning corporate” too soon.
