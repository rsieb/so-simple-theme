## Dear Startup Founder,##

* Does your startup **keep pivoting** to find new sources of growth?
* Are more and more **projects delivered late** or not at all?
* Are you **busy herding cats,** never able to please _everyone?_
* Does your **workload keep increasing,** the more people you hire?

## Have you Considered Startup Business Coaching? ##

* Startup coaches can guide  **the perfect playbook** for reaching the next level, post _product-market-fit_.
* As your trusted ally, they can help you **find new growth,** improve **team accountability,** and get **your time back.**
* Startup coaches provide **comprehensive tools,** facilitate your **executive offsites,** help set up an **execution rhythm** and help keep your **team accountable.**
* **Startup business coaching** focuses on **upskilling the entire team** and on **business results**--**not** on executive therapy sessions or getting founders to change personality.

## We Could be a Good Fit if... ##

* Your startup is a VC-backed <b>tech venture.</b> I am the only certified <!--a_gazelles.md-->Gazelles International Coach having **lived through three VC-backed tech scale-ups.**
* You are based in, or looking to be more connected to, Silicon Valley. I am based in San Francisco, have raised money and sold a tech company myself and I am a **winner of the Silicon Valley Founder Showcase.**
* You and your team are **eager to learn and improve fast** I set up high-paced, energetic workshops and execution rhythms that **drive results 2-3x faster** than competitors, if the team moves fast enough.
