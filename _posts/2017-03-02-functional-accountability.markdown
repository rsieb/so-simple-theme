# Who does what and how is it measured



One of the first exercises I do with a new client team, is to clear up the functional accountability. Coming into the workshop, everyone assumes they are clear on the role of every other team member.

With the exercise, it becomes obvious how different people interpret each other's responsibilities. No wonder most teams suffer from constant back-and-forth about who does what. Let alone whether their colleagues are doing a good job or a bad one.

To clear up functional accountability, we use the Gazelles [Function Accountability Chart (FACe)](https://www.getdrip.com/forms/57843536/submissions/new). With Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, it emphasizes getting the right people into the right seats.





  1. The first feature is that the tool defines the "right seats". These seats are independent of the specific titles people in the client company may have.



  2. The second feature is that it expects a single name in each box. Usually the team will find some names appear in several locations, and other names in none. This needs clearing up.



  3. The third feature is that it allows two sets of metrics. The leading metric is about the key activity of the function, e.g. meetings held or widgets produced. The lagging metric is for the outcome/result of the function: revenue, gross margin, profit etc.






[Complete the Function Accountability tool](https://www.getdrip.com/forms/57843536/submissions/new) with your team and use it next to the One-Page Strategic Plan. It will help you diagnose where you have people and performance gaps on the leadership team.
