# Tech Scaling-up Program Pricing


Pricing varies greatly depending on:



 	
  * the client I work with;

 	
  * the needs they have;

 	
  * the amount of work I do with them.


After building an understanding if the client is a good fit , we agree on pricing around the axes of:

 	
  * number of teams in the program;

 	
  * number of workshop days per year;

 	
  * frequency of results follow-up;

 	
  * basic, intermediate or advanced level scaling;

 	
  * ambition level of the envisioned outcome;

 	
  * number of custom requests.
