## Are your team "offsites" making a real impact?





As a growth company CEO, you take your team regularly offsite to see radical improvements in team trust, strategy, execution and results. But have the results matched your expectations?



* Do your current offsites feel more like an obligation?
* Are they taking too much time to prepare?
* Haven't found time to organize one at all?



## Workshops that generate breakthroughs





As a breakthrough growth facilitator, I help CEOs prepare, facilitate and successfully conclude the regular planning workshops of their leadership team. 





### Tackling the most difficult issues





With an external facilitator, leadership teams find it easier to identify the elephant in the room, discuss real issues, attack root causes and build a plan in full consensus.





### Faster, more reliable results





With 25 years of growth company experience , I can quickly help the team resolve obstacles for growth, take difficult decisions and commit to the results to be achieved.





### The best frameworks and toolkits





With ~150 Scaling Up™ tools and frameworks, teams can quickly elevate their thinking and find breakthrough solutions to otherwise intractable problems.





## Flexible facilitation rhythms





Breakthrough growth facilitation includes







  * Regular (quarterly, bimonthly or monthly) workshops with the leadership team


  * Integrating all breakthrough decisions into a "One Page Strategic Plan"


  * Monthly or biweekly video check-ins with the CEO


  * Software tools that help the team stay on track in between workshops
