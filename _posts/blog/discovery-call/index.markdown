# Scale your org, not just your tech



**Pain point:** [60% of tech founders lose the CEO position](http://www.scaleupally.com/scale-up-ally-for-tech-founders/) within four years because "they didn't scale". This is never about scaling the tech, always about scaling the org.



# Be the founder that stayed as CEO



**Solution:** I believe that [the original founders _can_ scale](http://www.scaleupally.com/scale-up-ally-for-tech-founders/), as long as they have [an experienced ally](http://www.scaleupally.com/why-work-with-me/) to help them make the needed changes;



# Scale your venture better than any outsider could



**Why me:** With over 25 years in tech scale-ups, I offer [tens of best scale-up practices](http://www.scaleupally.com/why-work-with-me/) right within the team's quarterly workshops, providing lots of learning without the need for additional time.
